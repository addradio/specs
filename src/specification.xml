        <title>General communication with Icecast2</title>
        <para>Communication with Icecast2 is based on HTTP. Icecast2 implements HTTP/1.0 with a set of features from HTTP/1.1 and some usecase specific extensions. In addition Icecast2 may support other protocols such as ICY.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Protocol Specification</title>
            <para>All Icecast2 clients connect to Icecast2 using the same server address. Mountpoints and general web access uses administor provided resource names. The administration interface and API is available below the resource prefix "/admin".</para>
            <para>Icecast2 implements HTTP/1.0. It understands most HTTP/1.1 requests. If interpretation of a request fails Icecast2 will send a HTTP/1.0 error reply depending on the reason of failture. If Icecast2 can not assume a HTTP client or the error occurs in early stages of client handling Icecast2 may drop the connection without sending data to the client.</para>

                <title>Error codes</title>
                <para>The server may respond with any <link xlink:href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6">RFC 7231 Section 6</link> status code. Below is a incomplete list of important status codes:

                <para>Authentication is based on <link xlink:href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617">RFC 7617</link>. The client must send a request with no authentication first. The server will include information in it's error response on how to provide authentication data correctly. This step may be skipped according to the rules in RFC 7617 only.</para>

                <note>RFC 7230 removed the "identity" encoding from the standard. See <link xlink:href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#appendix-A.2">RFC 7230 Appendinx A.2</link> for details.</note>

                        When chunked is not used as outmost transfer encoding the client can half-close the connection to signal the end of the request if the transport supports half-closed connections.
